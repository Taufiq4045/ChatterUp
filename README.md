## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatter
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine or provide a connection string to a MongoDB instance.
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the chat application at http://localhost:3000. Open multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate different users.
- Chat: Send and receive messages in real time.
- Message History: View past messages upon reconnecting.
- User Status: See online/offline status updates.

## Socket Programming
Chatter uses Socket.io to manage real-time communication between the server and clients. The socket connections are handled in the src/sockets/ directory, where events such as message, join, and disconnect are managed.

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/messages: Retrieve chat history.
- POST /api/messages: Send a new message.
- GET /api/status: Check user online status.
